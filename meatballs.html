				In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients. Mix well, do not over mix or you will have tough meatballs.
				Using a 2 tablespoon scoop, portion out meat and place on baking sheet. After all meatballs have been scooped onto
				tray, roll into balls. <br><br>
				COOK'S NOTE:  If you lightly wet your hands the meatballs will form better and crack less.<br><br>
				Bake for 20-22 minutes. Remove and transfer to sauce or serve immediately.</p>
